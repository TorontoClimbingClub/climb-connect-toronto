# Dual Architecture Development Workflow

## 🎯 Overview

This workflow ensures efficient development within climb-connect-toronto's dual architecture system. Follow these standardized procedures to make changes that properly consider both desktop and mobile experiences.

## 🚨 MANDATORY PRE-WORK CHECKLIST

Before making ANY UI/UX changes:

- [ ] **Read dual architecture map**: `CLAUDE_DUAL_ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`
- [ ] **Update component map**: `npm run ui:update-map`  
- [ ] **Identify component category**: Desktop-only, mobile-only, responsive, etc.
- [ ] **Understand breakpoint impact**: Will this affect 768px+ users, <768px users, or both?
- [ ] **Plan testing strategy**: Which screen sizes need verification?

## 🛠️ SPECIALIZED WORKFLOWS

### Adding New Responsive Components

```bash
# 1. Design Phase
# Determine component category:
# - Will it be desktop-only, mobile-only, or responsive?
# - What responsive behavior is needed?

# 2. Implementation Phase
# Use responsive utilities:
import { useIsDesktop, RESPONSIVE_CLASSES } from '@/utils/responsive';
import { useResponsiveLayout } from '@/hooks/useResponsive';

# 3. Testing Phase
# Test appropriate screen sizes based on component category

# 4. Documentation Phase
# Update CLAUDE_DUAL_ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md with new component
# Add to appropriate category section
```

### Debugging Responsive Issues

```bash
# 1. Identify Issue Category
# - Desktop-only issue: Check DesktopSidebar, GlobalSearch, etc.
# - Mobile-only issue: Check NavBar mobile menu, mobile overlays
# - Cross-platform issue: Check responsive components, layout system

# 2. Use Debug Utilities
# Add temporary debugging:
import { debugResponsiveState } from '@/utils/responsive';
debugResponsiveState(); // Check console for responsive state

# 3. Verify Breakpoint Logic
# Check 768px breakpoint behavior:
# - Resize browser to exactly 768px
# - Test behavior at 767px vs 768px
# - Verify CSS classes and JavaScript logic align

# 4. Test Layout Context
# Check if issue is layout-controlled:
# - Verify useDesktopLayout prop values
# - Check MultiPanelLayout configuration
# - Test panel visibility and responsive behavior
```

### Modifying Layout System

```bash
# 1. Understand Current Layout Flow
# Review ARCHITECTURE.md layout flow diagram
# Check Layout.tsx, MultiPanelLayout.tsx interaction

# 2. Identify Change Scope
# - Layout switching logic (Layout.tsx)
# - Panel configuration (MultiPanelLayout.tsx)  
# - Navigation integration (DesktopSidebar, NavBar)
# - Page layout usage (Dashboard, Events, Groups)

# 3. Make Coordinated Changes
# Update multiple components if needed:
# - Layout system components
# - Components using layout system
# - CSS classes and responsive utilities

# 4. Comprehensive Testing
# Test ALL layout combinations:
# - Mobile layout behavior
# - Desktop two-panel layout
# - Desktop three-panel layout  
# - Layout transitions at breakpoints
```

## 📊 TESTING MATRIX

| Component Type | Desktop Test | Mobile Test | Responsive Test | Layout Test |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Desktop-Only | ✅ Required | ❌ Not needed | ❌ Not applicable | ✅ If layout-related |
| Mobile-Only | ❌ Not needed | ✅ Required | ❌ Not applicable | ❌ Not applicable |
| Responsive | ✅ Required | ✅ Required | ✅ Required | ✅ If layout-related |
| Layout-Controlled | ✅ Required | ❌ Uses desktop layout | ✅ Layout transitions | ✅ Required |
| Shared | ✅ Required | ✅ Required | ❌ Basic responsive | ❌ Not applicable |
| Fullscreen Chat | ✅ Required | ✅ Required | ✅ Header only | ❌ Not applicable |

## 🚀 DEVELOPMENT EFFICIENCY TIPS

### Quick Component Identification
```bash
# Use component map search:
grep -i "componentname" CLAUDE_DUAL_ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md

# Check responsive utilities:
grep -r "useIsDesktop\|isDesktopScreen" src/

# Find layout usage:
grep -r "useDesktopLayout" src/
```

### Rapid Testing Setup
```bash
# Browser testing setup:
# Desktop: Chrome/Firefox window ≥768px wide
# Mobile: Chrome/Firefox window <768px wide  
# Responsive: Chrome DevTools device toolbar

# Quick breakpoint verification:
# Open browser console, run: window.innerWidth
# Should be ≥768 for desktop experience, <768 for mobile
```

### Common Patterns Reference
```typescript
// Desktop-only conditional
const isDesktop = useIsDesktop();
if (!isDesktop) return null;

// Responsive CSS classes
<div className="hidden md:block">Desktop content</div>
<div className="block md:hidden">Mobile content</div>

// Layout forcing
<Layout useDesktopLayout={true} layoutType="three-panel">

// Responsive hook usage
const { isDesktop, screenSize } = useResponsiveLayout();
```

## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

1. **Assuming Desktop-Only Changes Don't Affect Mobile**
   - Even desktop-only components can impact overall responsive behavior
   - Always consider layout context and component interactions

2. **Not Testing Breakpoint Transitions**  
   - Test exactly at 768px boundary
   - Verify smooth transitions when resizing browser
   - Check for layout shifts or flash of unstyled content

3. **Forgetting Layout-Controlled Context**
   - Some pages force desktop layout regardless of screen size
   - Check useDesktopLayout prop on parent Layout component
   - Understand when mobile users see desktop-forced layouts

4. **Inconsistent Responsive Utilities**
   - Use centralized utilities from `/src/utils/responsive.ts`
   - Don't hardcode breakpoint values in components
   - Maintain consistent 768px breakpoint throughout app

5. **Incomplete Testing Coverage**
   - Test all applicable platform combinations per component type
   - Don't skip responsive transition testing
   - Verify functionality, not just visual appearance

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

### Development Efficiency
- **Faster Component Targeting**: Use architecture map to quickly identify correct component
- **Reduced Testing Iterations**: Follow appropriate testing matrix for component type
- **Consistent Breakpoint Behavior**: Use centralized responsive utilities
- **Clear Development Decisions**: Component categorization guides implementation approach

### User Experience Quality
- **Platform-Optimized Experiences**: Desktop and mobile users get appropriate interfaces
- **Consistent Core Functionality**: Shared components work reliably across platforms
- **Smooth Responsive Transitions**: Layout changes are seamless at breakpoints
- **Performance**: Desktop-only code doesn't impact mobile bundle size
